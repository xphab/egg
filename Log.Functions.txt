phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity analysis


[A] Functions of main.r
1. Correct the sample names and prepare OTU table for resampling
2. Alpha diversity index
3. DCA
4. Taxa composition statistic by sample
5. Dissimilarity test (3 test methods and up to 5 distance methods)
6. DCA by large category (e.g. phyla, or Carbon cycling) of taxa
7. Sum by category (e.g. family, or gene family) of taxa
8. DCA of category-sum data
9. DCA of category-sum data by large category (seldom used)
x1. Output community data file and treatment information file in the format IEG microarray pipeline required.
p01. Calculate phylogenetic distance matrix from tree file (tree.nwk)
p02. List the species discarded when matching species in OTU table and tree file.
p03. MPD (mean phylogenetic distance)
p04. NRI (Nearest Relative Index)
p05. MNTD (mean nearest taxon distance)
p06. NTI (nearest taxon index)
p07. betaMPD (mean phylogenetic distance between each pair of samples)
p08. betaNRI (nearest relative index based on betaMPD)
p09. betaMNTD (mean nearest taxon distance between each pair of samples)
p10. betaNTI (nearest taxon index based on betaMNTD)
p11. Aggregate of phylogenetic alpha diversity indexes
p12. Aggregate of phylogenetic beta diversity indexes

[B] R function list
egg2.compare.test.r: temperary main R code to do comparison between two groups of numbers. It is developing.
vh.test.r: variance homogenity test between two groups of numbers. return p values of 4 commenly used methods
nor.test.r: normality test for a group of numbers. return p values of up to 6 commenly used methods.
egg.p.r: main function of phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity analysis and null model test.
mpdn.r: MPD
NRI.p.r: NRI (parallel computation)
mntdn.r: MNTD
