What is new?

egg2.compare.test.r: temperary main R code to do comparison between two groups of numbers. It is developing.
vh.test.r: variance homogenity test between two groups of numbers. return p values of 4 commenly used methods
nor.test.r: normality test for a group of numbers. return p values of up to 6 commenly used methods.


[A] Functions of main.r
1. Correct the sample names and prepare OTU table for resampling
2. Alpha diversity index
3. DCA
4. Taxa composition statistic by sample
5. Dissimilarity test (3 test methods and up to 5 distance methods)
6. DCA by large category (e.g. phyla, or Carbon cycling) of taxa
7. Sum by category (e.g. family, or gene family) of taxa
8. DCA of category-sum data
9. DCA of category-sum data by large category (seldom used)
x1. Output community data file and treatment information file in the format IEG microarray pipeline required.
